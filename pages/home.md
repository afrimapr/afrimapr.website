#### afrimapr was funded through Wellcome Open Research and Wellcome Data for Science and Health between 2020 - 2021. The project is no longer actively being supported and the website and resources will no longer be updated. However, we will keep the <a href="https://afrimapr.org">website</a> up for as long as possible and the <a href="https://github.com/afrimapr/">GitHub repositories</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnfv97BoQ9WtTrBJl67RgRA">Youtube channel</a> will stay accessible. We hope you will find the news, information, and resources useful.



_afrimapr_ started in 2020 and is funded through the [Wellcome Open Research Fund](https://wellcome.ac.uk/funding/people-and-projects/grants-awarded/afrimapr-facilitating-use-spatial-data-african-public) and [Wellcome Data for Science and Health](https://wellcome.org/what-we-do/our-work/data-science-and-health-trustworthy-data-science). 

_afrimapr_ creates R building blocks and learning resources to make it easier to make data-driven maps in Africa. 

The created resources are promoted in Africa and beyond to grow a community of users and developers to maintain and improve them. 

The R building blocks will make it easier to perform spatial data management tasks that should be straightforward, but seldom are, including: summarising data by administrative regions of different levels; joining and displaying data referenced by administrative region names; access to environmental, socio-economic and health data and displaying data in static maps and interactive web applications. 

Components are designed for ease of use to target new users of R.

_afrimapr_ also develops tutorials and runs online workshops. We hope to facilitate in-person workshops in the future.
