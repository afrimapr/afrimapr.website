# _afrimapr_



afrimapr was funded through the [Wellcome Open Research Fund](https://wellcome.ac.uk/funding/schemes/open-research-fund) and [Wellcome Data for Science and Health](https://wellcome.org/what-we-do/data-science-and-health-trustworthy-data-science) between January 2020 - July 2021.

The project continued to run monthly community meetups with support from [Talarify](https://talarify.co.za), beyond conclusion of the funding cycle.

All activity and development was stopped at the beginning of 2023 but repositories remain openly available,lesson materials are still being used, and we continue to explore ways to support our community through incorporating them into other existing initiatives such as [RSSE Africa](https://rsse.africa) and others.

# Original Readme

afrimapr will create R building blocks and learning resources to make it easier to make data-driven maps in Africa.

The created resources will be promoted in Africa and beyond to initiate a community of users and developers to maintain and improve them.

The R building blocks will make it easier to perform spatial data management tasks that should be straightforward, but seldom are, including: summarising data by administrative regions of different levels; joining and displaying data referenced by administrative region names; access to environmental, socio-economic and health data and displaying data in static maps and interactive web applications.

Components will be designed for ease of use to target new users of R.

We will run workshops in Liverpool, Ethiopia, Malawi and South Africa trialling and promoting resources.

## Contribute

We hope to build various communities around the building blocks:

- developers who can contribute to the R code, expand functionality, and make the tools sustainable 
- users who can try the software out in real live settings, tell us what features they would like to see, and write scripts utilising the _afrimapr_ building blocks in their own contexts and countries
- instructors who can help to teach others to use the _afrimapr_ building blocks
